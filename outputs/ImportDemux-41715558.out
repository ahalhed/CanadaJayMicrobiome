There was a problem importing input/rawFiles:

  /tmp/q2-SingleLanePerSamplePairedEndFastqDirFmt-u1w0zft3 is not a(n) SingleLanePerSamplePairedEndFastqDirFmt:

  These samples do not have matching pairs of forward and reverse reads: {'.G87'}

Usage: qiime demux summarize [OPTIONS]

  Summarize counts per sample for all samples, and generate interactive
  positional quality plots based on `n` randomly selected sequences.

Inputs:
  --i-data ARTIFACT SampleData[SequencesWithQuality |
    PairedEndSequencesWithQuality | JoinedSequencesWithQuality]
                       The demultiplexed sequences to be summarized.
                                                                    [required]
Parameters:
  --p-n INTEGER        The number of sequences that should be selected at
                       random for quality score plots. The quality plots will
                       present the average positional qualities across all of
                       the sequences selected. If input sequences are paired
                       end, plots will be generated for both forward and
                       reverse reads for the same `n` sequences.
                                                              [default: 10000]
Outputs:
  --o-visualization VISUALIZATION
                                                                    [required]
Miscellaneous:
  --output-dir PATH    Output unspecified results to a directory
  --verbose / --quiet  Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                       execution of this action. Or silence output if
                       execution is successful (silence is golden).
  --examples           Show usage examples and exit.
  --citations          Show citations and exit.
  --help               Show this message and exit.

                    There was a problem with the command:
