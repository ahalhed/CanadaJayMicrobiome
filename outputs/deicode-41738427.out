Usage: qiime emperor biplot [OPTIONS]

  Generates an interactive ordination biplot where the user can visually
  integrate sample and feature metadata. Vectors representing the n most
  important features are then plotted in the emperor visualization (5
  largest, by default).

Inputs:
  --i-biplot ARTIFACT PCoAResults % Properties('biplot')
                       The principal coordinates matrix to be plotted.
                                                                    [required]
Parameters:
  --m-sample-metadata-file METADATA...
    (multiple          The sample metadata
     arguments will    
     be merged)                                                     [required]
  --m-feature-metadata-file METADATA...
    (multiple          The feature metadata (useful to manipulate the arrows
     arguments will    in the plot).
     be merged)                                                     [optional]
  --p-ignore-missing-samples / --p-no-ignore-missing-samples
                       This will suppress the error raised when the
                       coordinates matrix contains samples that are not
                       present in the metadata. Samples without metadata are
                       included by setting all metadata values to: "This
                       sample has no metadata". This flag is only applied if
                       at least one sample is present in both the coordinates
                       matrix and the metadata.               [default: False]
  --p-invert / --p-no-invert
                       If specified, the point and arrow coordinates will be
                       swapped.                               [default: False]
  --p-number-of-features INTEGER
    Range(1, None)     The number of most important features (arrows) to
                       display in the ordination. “Importance” is calculated
                       for each feature based on the vector’s magnitude
                       (euclidean distance from origin).          [default: 5]
Outputs:

Miscellaneous:
  --output-dir PATH    Output unspecified results to a directory
  --verbose / --quiet  Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                       execution of this action. Or silence output if
                       execution is successful (silence is golden).
  --examples           Show usage examples and exit.
  --citations          Show citations and exit.
  --help               Show this message and exit.
