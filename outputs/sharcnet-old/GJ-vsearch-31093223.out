Usage: qiime diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic [OPTIONS]

  Applies a collection of diversity metrics (both phylogenetic and non-
  phylogenetic) to a feature table.

Inputs:
  --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                          The feature table containing the samples over which
                          diversity metrics should be computed.     [required]
  --i-phylogeny ARTIFACT  Phylogenetic tree containing tip identifiers that
    Phylogeny[Rooted]     correspond to the feature identifiers in the table.
                          This tree can contain tip ids that are not present
                          in the table, but all feature ids in the table must
                          be present in this tree.                  [required]
Parameters:
  --p-sampling-depth INTEGER
    Range(1, None)        The total frequency that each sample should be
                          rarefied to prior to computing diversity metrics.
                                                                    [required]
  --m-metadata-file METADATA...
    (multiple arguments   The sample metadata to use in the emperor plots.
     will be merged)                                                [required]
  --p-n-jobs INTEGER      [beta/beta-phylogenetic methods only, excluding
    Range(0, None)        weighted_unifrac] - The number of jobs to use for
                          the computation. This works by breaking down the
                          pairwise matrix into n-jobs even slices and
                          computing them in parallel. If -1 all CPUs are used.
                          If 1 is given, no parallel computing code is used at
                          all, which is useful for debugging. For n-jobs below
                          -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n-jobs) are used. Thus for n-jobs
                          = -2, all CPUs but one are used. (Description from

Parameters:
  --p-level INTEGER      The taxonomic level at which the features should be
                         collapsed. All ouput features will have exactly this
                         many levels of taxonomic annotation.       [required]
Outputs:
  --o-collapsed-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                         The resulting feature table, where all features are
                         now taxonomic annotations with the user-specified
                         number of levels.                          [required]
Miscellaneous:
  --output-dir PATH      Output unspecified results to a directory
  --verbose / --quiet    Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                         during execution of this action. Or silence output if
                         execution is successful (silence is golden).
  --citations            Show citations and exit.
  --help                 Show this message and exit.
